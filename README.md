# Lattice

An API Gateway written in Go

## TODO

-   [ ] Routing and Load Balancing:
    -   Route incoming requests to the appropriate backend services.
    -   Distribute requests evenly across multiple instances of a service to ensure high availability and reliability.
-   [ ] Authentication and Authorization:
    -   Verify the identity of clients using methods like API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWTs.
    -   Ensure that clients have the necessary permissions to access specific resources.
-   [ ] Rate Limiting and Throttling:
    -   Limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
-   [ ] Caching:
    -   Cache responses from backend services to reduce latency and improve performance for frequently requested data.
-   [ ] Request and Response Transformation:
    -   Modify incoming requests and outgoing responses to match the expected format of backend services and clients.
-   [ ] Logging and Monitoring:
    -   Log requests and responses for auditing and debugging purposes.
    -   Monitor traffic, performance, and errors to ensure the health of the system.
-   [ ] Security:
    -   Protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
    -   Ensure secure communication using HTTPS.
-   [ ] Service Discovery:
    -   Dynamically discover backend services and their instances to handle changes in the service topology.
-   [ ] Circuit Breaking and Failover:
    -   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when a backend service is down.
    -   Provide failover mechanisms to route traffic to healthy instances or fallback services.
-   [ ] API Versioning:
    -   Support multiple versions of APIs to allow for backward compatibility and smooth transitions between versions.
-   [ ] Data Aggregation:
    -   Aggregate data from multiple backend services into a single response to reduce the number of client requests.
-   [ ] Developer Portal:
    -   Provide a portal for developers to register, obtain API keys, and access documentation and usage analytics.
